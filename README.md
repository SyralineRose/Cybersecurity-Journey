Welcome! This repository documents my journey into cybersecurity, starting from zero and building toward a career in penetration testing.  

Here I collect:  
- 🧠 **Reflections** on what I learn from labs and challenges  
- 🛠️ **Techniques and tools** I practice along the way  
- 📂 **Notes** from TryHackMe and Hack The Box (no spoilers for active boxes)  
- 🔗 **Themes** that connect multiple labs into bigger concepts  

The aim is not just to log steps, but to show **growth, mindset, and transferable skills**.
