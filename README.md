This repository is my **personal cybersecurity training ground**.  
Instead of walkthroughs or writeups, I build and refine scripts that I use to:  
- 🛠️ Automate common enumeration and exploitation steps  
- 📚 Reinforce concepts by re-implementing them in code  
- 🧩 Create my own “practical exams” to test my skills  

The goal is to develop **real problem-solving ability**, not just follow lab instructions.

## 📂 Repository Structure  

- **/Scripts** → My custom scripts for Windows, Linux, and networking tasks  
- **/Exams** → Self-made practical exams combining scripts and scenarios  
- **/Notes** → Small reminders or reflections (no walkthroughs or spoilers)

## 🏷️ Skills I’m Building  

- Bash & PowerShell scripting  
- Python for automation  
- Enumeration (Windows, Linux, and networks)  
- Privilege escalation checks  
- Thinking like an attacker **and** practicing defensive awareness

## 🌱 Current Focus  

- Writing Bash scripts to automate Linux privilege escalation checks  
- Experimenting with PowerShell for Windows enumeration  
- Designing “mini exams” to practice under timed conditions  
- Strengthening problem-solving and attacker mindset
